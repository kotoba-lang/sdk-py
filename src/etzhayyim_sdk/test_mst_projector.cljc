;;
;; The endpoint has no default (see the note above `resolve-base-url`), so every test that
;; performs a query has to name a host, exactly as a real caller now must. This fixture names
;; one for the whole suite. Before the endpoint was made explicit these tests ran against the
;; invented "http://simeon.local:8765" fallback without ever saying so — which is precisely
;; how the defect stayed invisible.
;;
;; `real-base-url` captures the true implementation at load time, so the handful of tests
;; below that assert the *unconfigured* behaviour can restore it inside the fixture.
