;; test_llm.cljc — which host the LLM client contacts, and what it carries there.
;;
;; `etzhayyim-sdk.llm` is the one module in this SDK that transmits a credential: when
;; ETZHAYYIM_LLM_KEY is set, `auth-headers` attaches `Authorization: Bearer <key>` to every
;; POST. So the host it resolves must always be one somebody chose — never a name the SDK
;; invented for itself.
;;
;; The regression these cover: `llm-url` used to fall back to a literal
;; "http://levi.local:4000". `.local` is the mDNS/Bonjour namespace (RFC 6762), so that name
;; is claimable by any host on the same link, and `levi` is a private murakumo fleet node
;; that only exists on the operator's own network. With ETZHAYYIM_LLM_URL unset on a shared
;; network, `chat`/`translate` would hand the bearer token to whoever answered first.
;;
;; No real network calls: HTTP goes through the dynamic `llm/*request*` stub, exactly as
;; test_mst_projector.cljc stubs `mp/*request*`.
