;; mst.cljc — AT Protocol MST read/query helpers (cljc port of mst.py, ADR clj/bb repo
;; rule). Per ADR-2605172000. As in the python, the live-PDS binding is the M3 target, so
;; `query` / `council-attestation-details` / `council-objections` are stubs that throw a
;; NotImplementedError analogue (`::err/not-implemented`); tests redefine these directly.
;;
;; The python kept the httpx singleton + ETZHAYYIM_PDS_URL config even while the body was a
;; stub; both are preserved here (config via env, no httpx — when the M3 binding lands it
;; uses `babashka.http-client` like mst_projector, no new dependency). Config:
;;   ETZHAYYIM_PDS_URL (default http://atproto.etzhayyim.com).
